// here we will try to understand the difference beytweeen a normal function and an arrow function

//Normal function
function archit (){

    console.log (Hey this is a normal function)
}

archit();

//This is also a way to write function

const archit = function (){


    console.log (Hey this is also a normal function)
}

archit ();


// Arrow function

const archit = ()=> (){


    console.log (This is an arrow function)

}
archit ();

//another example
"one liners wont require braces/return"
""instead of ""



const greet = function (){
return "Goood Morning"
}


"" we can write ""


 const greet = ()=> "Good Morning";
 console.log (greet())
